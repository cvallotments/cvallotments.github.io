## Church Vale Allotments

We are a small group of families in High Pittington, Durham, growing veggies, fruit and flowers and enjoying the peace and quiet of our lovely location.  The allotments back on to trees and fields, and we often see and hear wildlife.

Church Vale Allotment Association was formed in 2008 and is based in High Pittington, Durham. There are 15 established plots we always welcome interest from new people from the parish of Pittington.

We all enjoy the outdoor life and spend our time digging or discussing the best way to grow our produce.  Some of us have lots of experience, and others are just learning.

It’s great fun, and there’s nothing like eating your own fruit and veg!
